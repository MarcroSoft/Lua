# Lua with CMake Support
Almost unaltered [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) source code and documentation with [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build infrastructure. This repository contains different Lua versions extracted from https://www.lua.org/download.html. Tested generators and architectures are:

- Visual Studio 17 2022, Win32
- Visual Studio 17 2022, x64

**Notice:** Present `Makefiles` originate from Lua source code archive and are not used within the context of CMake-based build.

## Windows Tool Chain Preparation

A complete Microsoft Visual Studio Installation is optional but not strictly necessary. Simply install **Buildtools for Visual Studio 2022** from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022 and select  the following minimum components for download and installation:

- MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++-x64/x86-Buildtools
- C++-CMake-Tools for Windows
- Windows 11-SDK

## Building and Installing Lua

Open `Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022` and change drive and directory. Download and unpack sources or simply clone this repository:

```cmd
c:
cd c:\Temp
git clone https://github.com/OneLuaPro/lua.git
cd lua
```

CMake strongly encourages out-of-source builds.

```cmd
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A <arch>
cmake --build . --config Release
cmake --install . --config Release
```

Replace `<arch>` with your desired architecture. Available architectures with selected `Visual Studio 17 2022` generator are `Win32`, `x64`, `ARM` and `ARM64`. Default installation directory is `C:\Apps\lua-<VERSION>` where a directory structure according to [GNU Coding Standards](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html) is created:

- `bin`: Lua binaries `lua.exe` and `luac.exe`, both statically linked, no DLL dependency,
- `include`: Public header files,
- `lib`: Lua static library `liblua.lib` (see *Bytecode-only library* below for the second one),
- `share`: documentation, man-pages, CMake configuration.

The default installation path can be overwritten by using `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` at the command line during CMake configuration. Example:

```cmd
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="C:\Foo\Bar"
```

Finally add the path to Lua to Windows search path for executables. 

```cmd
setx PATH "%PATH%;<INSTALL_PREFIX>\lua-<VERSION>\bin"
```

Open an new command window and test lua. Use `CTRL-C` to leave Lua in interactive mode.

```cmd
C:\Users\John Doe>lua
Lua 5.4.8  Copyright (C) 1994-2025 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
> print(_VERSION)
Lua 5.4
>
C:\Users\John Doe>
```

## Extras

In addition to the standard Lua executables `lua.exe` and `luac.exe`, a third binary is built: `wlua.exe`. This executable is functionally identical to `lua.exe` but is compiled for a different **Windows subsystem** (Windows GUI instead of Console). This is particularly useful for Lua-based GUI applications, as it prevents the annoying empty terminal window from appearing in the background. Lua GUI applications can be launched using a batch file as follows:

```bat
@echo off
pushd "%~dp0"
start "" wlua.exe "%~dp0prog.lua" %*
popd
exit
```

## Bytecode-only library

Alongside `liblua.lib` the build produces `liblua_bco.lib`, a second static
library for embedders that only ever load precompiled bytecode. It leaves out
the Lua front-end - `lparser.c`, `lcode.c`, `llex.c` and `ldump.c` - together
with `loadlib.c`, `liolib.c` and `ldblib.c`, so `require`, `io` and `debug` are
not in the sandbox it opens. Loading source text fails with `LUA_ERRSYNTAX` and
the message `<chunkname>: source loading is disabled (bytecode only)`; loading
and running bytecode is unchanged.

Everything that makes this work lives in `src/lnoparser.c`, which defines the
three symbols the rest of the library uses to reach the front-end (`luaX_init`,
`luaY_parser`, `luaU_dump`) and stands in for `linit.c`'s `luaL_openlibs`.
Nothing else is patched: every `.c` and `.h` file under `src/` is byte-identical
to the official lua-5.4.8 release, so upgrading to a later 5.4.x is a plain
drop-in of `src/`.
